## Simple News Application

A simple News Proof of Concept (POC) application that displays top headlines from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/). The application utilizes the BLoC pattern, MVVM architecture, Dependency Injection, Retrofit, and ensures separation of concerns for Data layer, Domain layer, and Presentation layer.

## Features

- **BLoC Pattern**: Implements the Business Logic Component (BLoC) pattern for efficient state management.

- **MVVM Architecture**: Adheres to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern for a structured and maintainable codebase.
